# Defining Native Applications

A Native Application is described by an application profile — a YAML document with applicationProfile at its root — that defines the workload (container, VM, or binary), its runtime environment, and the requirements that govern where and how it runs.

## Profile Structure

Every application profile follows this layout:

```
applicationProfile:
  metadata:
    # application identity and annotations
  specs:
    # runtime, resources, network, constraints, qos
  status:
    # runtime state, updated dynamically

```

 | Field
 | Type
 | Required
 | Description

 | applicationProfile.metadata
 | object
 | ✅
 | Application metadata — see metadata

 | applicationProfile.specs
 | object
 | ✅
 | Application requirements — see the specs sections below

 | applicationProfile.status
 | object
 | ❌
 | Runtime state, updated dynamically — see status
